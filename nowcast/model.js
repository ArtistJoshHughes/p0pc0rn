// nowcast/model.js - the Nowcast's model interface. The radar reader, the place lookup, the summary and the map only use what is
// here: a model's spec (its input product, grid, frames and cadence; its output frames; its credit and licence) and run(inputs) ->
// frames. Another nowcast model (another grid, other inputs) drops in as one more entry with its own engine behind the same calls.
